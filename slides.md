## Preface

In today's age of technology, distractions are all around us.  In this web presentation I will display a few
such distractions, and some solutions / steps you can take to alleviate their impact on your productivitiy.

-----

## Noise / Sound

---

## Solution:

- Noise cancelling headphones, I recommend [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0723CYHPZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
- If able to move, move to a quieter location.
- Make sure to fully turn off the TV, dont just put it on low, even the moving images will distract you.
- If listening to music, make sure it is not too loud, else you have defeated the point!

-----

## Social Media / Messaging

---

## Solution:

- Place phone on mute / silent during work hours.
- Use [Focus Assist](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-focus-assist-on-or-off-in-windows-10-5492a638-b5a3-1ee0-0c4f-5ae044450e09) on Windows, configure priority applications.
- Get in the habit of leaving your phone at your desk when you take a break.
- Configure [Digital Wellbeing](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en) on Android or [Screen Time](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use) on iPhones.
