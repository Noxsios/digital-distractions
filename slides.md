## Preface

In today's age of technology, distractions are all around us.  In this web presentation I will display _a few_
such distractions, and some solutions / steps you can take to alleviate their impact on your productivitiy.

## Noise / Sound

## Solution:

- Noise cancelling headphones, I recommend [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0723CYHPZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
- If able to move, move to a _quieter_ location.
- Make sure to fully turn off the TV, dont just put it on low, even the moving images will distract you.
- If listening to music, make sure it is not too loud, else you have defeated the point!

## Social Media / Messaging

## Solution:

- Place phone on mute / silent during work hours.
- Use [Focus Assist](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-focus-assist-on-or-off-in-windows-10-5492a638-b5a3-1ee0-0c4f-5ae044450e09) on Windows, configure priority applications.
- Get in the habit of leaving your phone at your desk when you take a break.
- Configure [Digital Wellbeing](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en) on Android or [Screen Time](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use) on iPhones.

## Multi-tasking

---

## Solution:

- Humans are __single__ threaded processes, we just switch between tasks fast.
- Block out sections of time in your calendar to single tasks.
  - During these blocks, only do __that__ task, nothing else.
- Make a list of ranked tasks and execute sequentially, __don't skip tasks!__

-----

## Hunger / Snacking

---

## Solution:

- Have a [consistent](https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/nutrition/best-times-to-eat) eating schedule, eat meals at the same time each day.
- [Avoid](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-tips-to-stop-mindless-eating) keeping food at your desk, separate eating and work as much as possible.
- Drink your daily amount of [water](https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/data-statistics/plain-water-the-healthier-choice.html) _throughout_ the day.
  - Added bonus: breaks up your day with bathroom breaks.

## Stress

---

## Solution:

Personally, I utilize _Google Calendar_ and creating daily To-Do lists in _Google Keep_
as a way to schedule out my tasks and reduce stress from time crunches.  Dealing with stress 
is different for everyone, so for this distraction I opted to provide resources and processes.

- This [article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/315243) has a few methods.
- [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/about/copingwith-stresstips.html) guidance.
- [UK NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/tips-to-reduce-stress/) guidance.
- [Sutter Health](https://www.sutterhealth.org/health/mind-body/10-simple-ways-to-cope-with-stress) article.
