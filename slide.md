## Noise / Sound

## Solution:

- Noise cancelling headphones, I recommend [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0723CYHPZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
- If able to move, move to a quieter location.
- Make sure to fully turn off the TV, dont just put it on low, even the moving images will distract you.
- If listening to music, make sure it is not too loud, else you have defeated the point!
